# WNKmaster 2000

This is the WNKmaster soldering station project.

## Purpose
Weller has some very nice micro soldering tools in the WX, and older WM series.
Sadly, these tools, and especially the soldering stations are hideously expensive.

There already exist a few projects that support the older, analog WM series, but
availability for those tools is starting to decline. So, I set out to design and
build a soldering station for the WX series tools, and this is the result.

### Features
- Compatible with Weller WX series tools, like WXMT and WXMP.
- Supports two tools
- Supports 12V and 24V tools (24V untested, though)
- Supports all original Weller tool settings
- Saves tool settings to FAT FS
